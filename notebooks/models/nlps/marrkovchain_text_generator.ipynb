    "## What is a Markov Chain?\n",
    "A Markov Chain is a stochastic model that describes a sequence of possible events where the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. It is widely used in various fields such as natural language processing, game theory, and statistical modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of text generation, a Markov Chain can be used to model the probability of a word following another word based on a given text corpus. By training a Markov Chain on a dataset, we can generate new sequences of text that mimic the style and structure of the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Does It Work?\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: The input text is split into individual words or tokens.\n",
    "2. **Transition Graph**: A graph is built where each word is a node, and edges represent the probability of transitioning to the next word.\n",
    "3. **Text Generation**: Starting from a given word (or prompt), the model selects the next word based on the probabilities in the graph. This process is repeated to generate a sequence of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a Markov Chain-based text generator using Python. It reads text data from CSV files, trains a Markov Chain model, and generates new text sequences based on user input."
